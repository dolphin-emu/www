* Using more of django-annoying where it makes sense, particularly @render_to.

* Provide some fake data sets to use as initial database contents.

* Download UI: too confusing for users, way too many versions displayed on the
  downloads page. Simplify the view with two side by side options: stable or
  latest. Explain the benefits. Have links to a more complete downloads page
  with older versions.

* Guides rework: better list page, i18n support, better loading time
  (pre-caching with hooks on the wiki?)

* Compatibility list search/autocompletion support
